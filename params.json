These type annotations are compatible with current versions of python. \r\nThey can be ignored altogether, used however you wish in your own program, or used to typecheck your code with [mypy](github.com/python/mypyp).\r\nThis post will discuss the last option. Later we'll see how python's strong introspective powers can be used to leverage these types in conjunction with\r\nmypy.\r\n\r\n`mypy` enables static typing in python. The features include defacto case-classes (using named tuples) and Union types. These are known\r\nmore generally as \"product types\" and \"sum types\" respectively. A product type is similar to a class in Java. It has pre-defined members (private or public)\r\nof other types. In a sense it is a \"product\" of these other types. In mypy, one can declare a product type using classes, or more simply using `NamedTuple.`\r\nFor example, let's create a product type for points in a 3D plane.\r\n```python\r\nPoint3D = NamedTuple(\"Point3D\", [(\"x\", float), (\"y\", float), (\"z\", float)])\r\n```\r\nIf we wanted to use a simple tuple instead, we could declare that so:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nPoint3DTuple = Tuple[float, float, float]\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's look at what our named tuple can, and more importantly can't, do within mypy's type world. All the displayed errors\r\nare part of mypy's output, which provides the line of the error as well as an explanation. Keep in mind these are all erorrs caught before\r\nthe program, or even any tests, are run. These errors can also be integrated with editors or IDEs to provde real-time feedback.\r\n\r\nIt can be created and accessed just like `collections.namedtuple.`\r\n```python\r\npoint = Point3D(0, 1.0, 3.98)\r\nx = point.x\r\ny = point[1] # this typechecks, it probably shouldn't\r\n```\r\nmypy knows how long the tuple is, and what types its members are!\r\n```python\r\nr = point[99]\r\nfoo.py:10: error: Tuple index out of range\r\n```\r\nmypy enforces the safety of common operators. This avoids meaningless comparisons, for example, which are uncaught by python's runtime:\r\n```python\r\n>>> \"foo\" > sys.maxint\r\n True # sure, why not?\r\n```\r\n```python\r\npoint.x + \"Eureka\"\r\nfoo.py:10: error: Unsupported operand types for + (\"float\" and \"str\")\r\n\r\nx = point.x # mypy infers the type after assignment\r\n\r\nx > \"Eureka\"\r\nfoo.py:10: error: Unsupported operand types for > (\"float\" and \"str\")\r\n```\r\nmypy limits attribute access:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsneaky = point.gecko\r\nfoo.py:13: error: \"Point3D\" has no attribute \"gecko\"\r\n```\r\nmypy supports generics. A generic can be a lot of things; A `list`, an `Iterable`, or something equivalent to scala/java 8's `Option` type. If a generic is a collection, all elements of the collection must be of the same type. mypy comes equipped with a number of generic types; take for example `List`, which is an alias for the built-in `list`.\r\n```python \r\nListOfInts = List[int]\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also create types by subclassing `Generic`.\r\n```python\r\nclass Option(Generic[T]):\r\n    def getOrElse(t: T) -> T:\r\n       . . . \r\n```\r\nIt's possible to use multiple type variables within a generic:\r\n```python\r\nE = TypeVar(\"E\")\r\nV = TypeVar(\"V\")\r\nclass Either(Generic[E,V]):\r\n    . . . . \r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's use `List` and `3DPoint` to create a more complex product type: `Robot Legs`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nRobotLegs = NamedTuple(\"RobotLegs\", [(\"leftLeg\", List[Point3D]), (\"rightLeg\", List[Point3D]), (\"color\", str)])\r\n```\r\nNote that we've defined the field `color` as simply a string, allowing us to create robot legs with nonsense colors. It's also possible to create robot legs with negative integers for coordinates! We only want pastel colors, and robots which exist in the cartesian plane. \r\n```python\r\nblueRobot = RobotLegs(points, points, \"fizbizzle\")\r\n```\r\nOf course, we could check for this condition in the functions that use the color:\r\n```python\r\ndef getColor(legs: RobotLegs) -> int:\r\n    if legs.color not in [\"skyblue\", \"red\", \"white\"]:\r\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid color %s\" % legs.color)\r\n    else:\r\n         . . . . \r\n```\r\nThat's a hassle, and it's easy to forget to do these checks in every function. Instead, let's nip this in the bud. \r\nWe really want to make it is easy on ourselves and be *really really sure* that we only have to validate our input once. We can do all the validation--cleaning up data from I/O, verifying it matches a certain shape, creating errors etc.--when we construct the instances of our types. That way all functions which accept those types are relieved from the obligation of checking themselves.\r\n```python\r\nSkyBlue = NamedTuple(\"SkyBlue\", [])\r\nPastelRed = NamedTuple(\"PastelRed\", [])\r\nWhite = NamedTuple(\"White\", [])\r\n\r\nColor = Union[Blue, PastelRed, White]\r\n\r\nRobotLegs = NamedTuple(\"RobotLegs\", [(\"leftLeg\", List[Point3D]), (\"rightLeg\", List[Point3D]), (\"color\", Color)])\r\n```\r\nNow we can be assured that our color is one of the primaries (always a good starting pint for giant robots), so we don't have to worry about validating our data again!\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef getColor(legs: RobotLegs) -> int:\r\n    if legs.color == SkyBlue():  return 0x87CEFA \r\n    if isinstance(legs.color, SkyBlue): return  0x87CEFA # this is equivalent\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can even safely use a statically typed dictionary which never raise a KeyErorr:\r\n```python\r\ncolors = { SkyBlue() : 0x87CEFA } # type: Dict[Color,int]\r\n. . . . \r\n```\r\nNow, let's make sure the 3D coordinates are valid. For this, we'll need something more powerful than a simple `NamedTuple`. We'll want to refuse all non-positive input. But note that a traditional python class won't be safe because python classes are mutable by default! It doesn't do much good to make a safe `3DPoint` if one can simply overwrite its attributes. But we can create more complex immutable objects in python:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Coordinate(object):\r\n    def __new__(self, x: float, y: float, z: float) -> Point3D:\r\n        assert x >= 0 and y >= 0 and z >= 0\r\n        return Point3D(x, y, z)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn fact it's possible to use this technique to *guarantee* that our function will only ever get valid input. It's only possible to construct the sum type of `RobotLegs` through the union type of `Color`; `Color` is by definition one of `Blue`, `Red`. . . and points\r\nIn languages with the concept of private constructors, it's possible to *guarantee* that a RobotLegs cannot be created an invalid state--and therefore that `getColor` can never be passed invalid data--by making the `RobotLegs` constructor private. Unfortunately, we can only document the `make3DCoordinates` function as the point of entry for our API--we can't exclude the constructor as private.\r\n\r\nNote that the assurance offered by static typing is significantly stronger than the contract offered by ducked typing. If we simply accepted an object with `leftLeg` `rightLeg` and `color` as a RobotLeg, we'd have no guarantees that these fields were valid, or even that they were the expected type!\r\n\r\n`Color` is a very simple Union type, analogous to the \"Enums\" of other languages (including python 3), while providing additional safety. Bution union types are more powerful; it's possible to create a union type out of product types, and model arbitrary complex \r\nsystems this way. You can think of these types as representing the \"set of all possible inputs and outputs\" and functions accepting these types as representing the \"cobminators\" or \"all the things I can ever do with my inputs\". Together, these form a sort of \"algebra\" that represents your domain. In the domain of giant robots:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nRifle = NamedTuple('Rifle', [('ammo' , int), ('model' , str)])\r\nKnife = NamedTuple('Knife', [('shape' , List[Coordinate]), ('thatsNotAKnife', bool)])\r\n\r\nweapon = Union[Rifle, Knife]\r\n\r\nRobotLegs = NamedTuple(\"RobotArms\", [(\"leftArm\", List[Coordinate]), (\"rightArm\", List[Coordinate]), (\"color\", Color)])\r\n\r\nGiantRobot = NamedTuple('GiantRobot', [('weapon', Weapon), ('legs' , RobotLegs), ('arms', RobotArms)])\r\n\r\ndef canFight(robot: GiantRobot) -> bool:\r\n    if isinstance(robot.weapon, Rifle):\r\n        return robot.weapon.ammo > 0\r\n    else: \r\n        return not robot.weapon.thatsNotAKnife # this is a knife\r\n```\r\nThe `isinstance` check tells mypy that `robot.weapon` is specifically a rifle, and therefore has an `ammo` field of type `int`. Without that check, we get a nifty error from mypy--and find out before testing, running, or deploying:\r\n```python\r\nfoo.py: note: In function \"canFight\":\r\nfoo.py:35: error: Some element of union has no attribute \"ammo\"\r\n```\r\nGreat! we've created an API that's clear, self-documenting, and compartively safe. We've provided some limited guarantees of correctness;\r\nand our domain is well-defined, which will help us reason about our past and future code moving forward.\r\nmypy is a growing project; it's still in an early stage and being actively developed. It's become an official\r\npart of they [python](github.com/python) flock as the definitive optional typechecker; it's got the [backing](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/1276#issuecomment-192981427)\r\nand [involvement](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/1277) of [python's creator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum).\r\n\r\nAlthough mypy is still in active development, it can be a profitable tool right now. It's not a compiler, and it never touches\r\nyour code, so it can be used without much concern for bugs. It takes some extra time to annotate python with types--I've demonstrated\r\nsome of the strengths of its type inference, but it's necessary to annotate some things like lambda expressions, for example.\r\nIt's well worth the effort to document and verify your code in one way or another--mypy is another excellent tool for this purpose.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
